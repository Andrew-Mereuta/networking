## Assignments
### A.1
Number of nodes is: 403. \
Number of links is: 9889. \
Average degree is: 48.95. \
Standaard deviation of the degree is: 31.71

### A.2
![Degree distribution of the network](./a_2.png)

A scale free graph has a power law degree distribution and an ER random graph has a posson degree distribution.
The degree distribution of our network is much more like a poisson graph.
This means that an ER random graph is more suitable to model our network.

### a.3
The assortative degree corelation of the graph is -0.0693, which is close, but just below zero. This means that the graph is mainly non-assorsative, with a realy small prefference to disassorsative.
In the real world this means that the nodes have no prefference in having links with similar or dissimilar nodes.
